# 07-nodejs-npm-express

**Author**: Bessie Arino, Melanie Cohen and Brian Bixby
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
We created a server that now renders our home and new pages and 404 page errors.

## Getting Started
First a user needs to have Node installed on their computer and do a npm init and create a gitignore and then download npm packages for express and body-parser. Next the user would need to create a server that can send a response. From here we added middleware that allows static files to be rendered from our public folder. Lastly, we established our routs to our home, new and 404 pages and within these routes we had to specify the root for each.

## Architecture
We utilized Node and NPM Express, body-parser, github, Javascript, HTML and CSS
