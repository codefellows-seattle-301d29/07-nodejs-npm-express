**Today, Bessie, Brian, and Melanie paired together. It took about 2 hours**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we reviewed the starter code and created a copy.
  2. Next, we ran `npm init -y` to set up meta information for the project.
  3. Next, we installed express and body-parser packages
  4. We then worked on the server.js file, adding an app.listen method, and made sure our server was running correctly
  5. We then added express tags and app.get methods, including a 404 error that served an image
